# Quiz Application

## Description

This is a simple quiz application that allows users to take a quiz and see their score at the end.
The application has two buttons when starting up - one to start the quiz and one to view the gallery which is a collection of images and their corresponding names
In the gallery a user can also add their own images and name to the gallery, and deleting them by holding down on the image.

When the user starts the quix the user gets an image of a person and three
options with names on who the image is of. The user can then click on the name of the person they think the image is and get a response if they were correct or not. Then a new image will be prompted 
the app also keeps track of the score and displays it throughout the quiz.
Images that are added to the gallery after startup will also be included in the quiz.
